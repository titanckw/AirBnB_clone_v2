## Introduction
This is the second part of the AirBnB clone project for holberton school in this case we need to update the console and create the MySQL part that will be used for testing and manage objects of our project.

## How to start the console
For start the console you can do it on an interactive mode using ```./console.py``` or on an non-interactive mode using ```echo "command" | ./console.py```(where command is the command that will be passed)

For example:

(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
$ cat test_help
help
$
$ cat test_help | ./console.py
